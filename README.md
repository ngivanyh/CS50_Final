This is a simple, easy-to-use english dictionary. Based off of [Wordnet](https://wordnet.princeton.edu/), and the database of words were copied from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dfydata/wordnet-dictionary-thesaurus-files-in-csv-format). This project was made using [Python](https://www.python.org/), [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/), and [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html). You can specify the colors of words with multiple meanings for a better viewing experience. There is also a "Word of the Day" for you to test your vocabulary skills.
